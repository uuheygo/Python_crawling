Marlboro College requires students to participate in planning their own programs and act responsibly within a self-governing community to promote independence. While students form their own concentrations, there are 34 fields of study/degree fields offered at Marlboro, from which students choose. Students are given great independence – but they have to earn that right. By the end of second semester, all freshmen are required to pass the Clear Writing Program. That is, submit 20 pages or 5,000 words of non-fiction writing to a committee for evaluation; students whose writing isn’t up to snuff must complete a new portfolio by the end of the following semester. Beginning with the Class of 2013, the college is guaranteeing admission to its Graduate and Professional Studies programs in nearby Brattleboro for Marlboro’s graduating seniors and awarding these students a scholarship equivalent to 50% of the graduate tuition.",http://www.forbes.com/colleges/marlboro-college/?list=top-colleges
