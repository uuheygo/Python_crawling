#---------calculation of indexes----------
# 1. individual indexes are calculated by dividing result counts by average counts;
#    the average is pre-calculated;
#    the individual indexes are calculated before importing to db;
# 2. composite indexes are calculated as sum of multiplication between indexes and their corresponding weight factor;
#    composite indexes are stored in a separate Table

#---------run program-----------
1. Main program is auto_processing.py which calls other methods in other modules to crawl and process data, and import to databases
2. School English and Chinese names with additional key word are stored in school_info.csv
3. For testing, you'll need to change the range of school list(line 35 in crawl_bd_gg.py) to crawl only for a few schools
4. In auto_processing.py, adjust the IPs pass to import_to_db() method for your own uses
5. If you want to add keywords for crawling schools, do it in crawl_db_gg.py
